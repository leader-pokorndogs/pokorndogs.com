So I move it to the desktop and it magically works? what the fuck
make sure the SLDWKS .dxf importer DISPLAYS THE ACTUAL FILE PATH


This project serves various puropses (posthumuously created):
- Explore the Inkscape <-> Solidworks process
- Explore the viablilty of topographic map creation
- Not much else, this is starting to look like a time sink
- At least it's something to put on the site

Actually I'd say ~4 hours were first-time-process losses
