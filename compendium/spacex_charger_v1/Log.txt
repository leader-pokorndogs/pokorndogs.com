	Will update design to V2
	- Export design from Inkscape, provide pattern
	- Make sure it is a goddamnn assembly
	- Remove ridges, raise and recess tabs (likely need to scale entire assembly down)
	- Remove seam: Small inset cover on the bottom?    yes, for protection
	- .4 or .6 nozzle size
	- Add space for adhesive grips
