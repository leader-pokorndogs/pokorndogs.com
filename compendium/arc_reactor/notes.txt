4/7/2020 - Start of redraw
	Re-drew cover, diffuser     rounded dimensions to tenths place
	Did not add alignment tabs yet, waiting to see if 3 is best? maybe 1?

4/8/2020 - Continue redraw, redesign cage
	Removed frontward-most gap to match movie, preserved most of previous favorite design
	Added "socket" again, it just needs to be there      made it fit, not movie accurate i believe
	
	New cap, similar to old but with forked tabs / more fillets / "H" plug                
	either whole cap or plug needs to be separated to minimize supports
	modified plug for cable to pass through? maybe cable sneakily passes out side in display
		OR PLUG COVERS THE EXISTING WIRE CONNECTOR, REMOVED (or switched) WHEN DISPLAYED 	
	

	I guess not too much work left, the cage was the bad part

4/9/2020 - Continued redraw + new stuff
	Separated cage and plug
	Added alignment tabs
	Added light puck
	Created rough stand, may need to change
	
	Satisfied with progress, it's going to be a good product

4/18/2020 - Cover printed 
	doors need to be kept open, heat warps outside

4/19/2020 - Diffuser printed 

4/20/2020 - First cage printed - test assemble - add core
	Used pla_0.3 profile and the cage was great
		slightly increase the x/y support distance?   probably don't change anything
	Will need new EL panel (digikey), will not be lighting up back??
		unsure how much light should be in the back, may need to print a test
		maybe add secondary LEDs? there's room         like soft standby lights or something

	Designed a core, roughly based off of IM3 arc reactor https://www.therpf.com/forums/threads/ironman-3-arc-reactor.280756/
		Should have sufficient play in Z direction
		Added route for wires, mostly hidden
		Removed alignment tabs from cage, will need to align to cable route with glue
